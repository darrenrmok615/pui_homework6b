Inside this folder contains the HTML and CSS files for the following pages on the BunBunBakeShop prototype: Home page, Shop page (Product browsing + product detail page), About page and cart page. The Home page utilizes a animation for the "Try out Original..." button found from this tutorial video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1KP6yrCP0c. Referenced https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEAl7L62GEw for javascript code. Also checked out example carts from: https://speckyboy.com/free-shopping-cart-css-javascript/. All other code is entirely my own.
